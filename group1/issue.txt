Jaize, 

I created this change so I could attach it to the open issue I have assigned to you.
Will you please replace group1 with your jaize folder inside of group2. 
I am hoping we can get squared away by class on project and assignment expectations. 
I laid out some topics we need to go over in the README.md as well as where we are at on our group assignment and assignments.

This file will need to be deleted ( there has to be a better way of attaching code to an issue) Will you please make these changes and close this issue when done.

Thanks!
