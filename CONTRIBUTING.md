# Welcome!

Welcome to The Game! This is an open source project for students in IT 115. The goal of the project is to make a bunch of web application code so we can all practice
managing this code on GitHub. 

## Environment Details

Part of the class is to explore different development enviroments. This repository will be for code contributions from all class members. The class is divided into groups.
There is a directory for group. Each student should only contribute code to the directory for his/her group. The GitHub security model allows each contributor access
to the entire repository, but please be responsibe and put your code in your assigned directory!

This is going to be a web application. The directory structure will work like a tree.

## Testing

You can test the latest version of The Game at this URL:

http://the-game-demo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/index.html

Our current testing procedure is to click on each link and check for broken links and missing pages. 

## Bug Reports

Report bugs to your group's leader. You can also report bugs here:
